# Callout Modular Markdown Plugin

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

It adds a few inline features to the callout component.
With this Plugin installed it's possible to create custom Callouts on the fly.
Callouts can now be created in any base color, and then get any icon applied by adding its name seperated by a hyphen, like so `[!{colorName}-{iconName}]`
